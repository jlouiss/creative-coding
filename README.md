## Commands
* create: `canvas-sketch --new <sketch-name> [--open] [--stream]`
  * `--open` to open in the default browser
  * `--stream` to make it streamable (cmd + shift + s to save video (toggle start/stop))
* build: `canvas-sketch --build --inline <sketch-name> --dir dist/`
  * (for netlify I rename the output to index.html, can be improved)
